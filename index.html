                Happy 21st birthday! Sorry that we couldn't be there
                in person to celebrate, but we miss you and 
                can't wait to see you soon - 
                in the meantime, here's a little something we
                put together for you! 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                We were thinking that sending
                packages or letters in this time could be risky 
                so we wanted to send you this book of virtual letters
                instead! We all appreciate you so much and we're
                so happy you're in all of our lives. We love you so much, and 
                we'll see you before you know it!
               </p>
